# Coffeetracker
A Python and Qt-App which lets you track the amount of consumables (e.g. coffees) in your department (and more).
With this app you can add a quantity to a db of coworkers and estimate the consumption or similar (in case of this example we use coffe).
Later you can even chose to pay your debt (if you need to pay for it) or just generate competition graphs just for fun and to know who drank the most.
